# Phobos

Phobos's goal is to be an optimizing bytecode compiler for Lua with some language extensions and a type system.\
At the moment it compiles regular Lua with the result being nearly identical to Lua itself, however it contains some more utilities than just compiling, the vast majority of which are currently only usable as a library.

Phobos supports bytecode with the default Lua 5.2 signature.

# Contributors

Huge thanks to justarandomgeek for starting the project in the first place (writing the majority of the first iteration of the parser and starting on the actual compiler) and then helping me understand several parts of compilers in general, the Lua VM, Lua bytecode and Lua internals.

Thanks to Therenas for providing built Lua and LuaFileSystem binaries for macOS and ensuring Phobos runs properly on macOS.

Thanks to the factorio modding community for providing input, ideas and discussion about Phobos as a whole. Without several people wanting types and no longer wanting to micro optimize their code Phobos would never have happened.
