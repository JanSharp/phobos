# Phobos

Phobos is an optimizing bytecode compiler for Lua with minor language extensions.

## Safe Chaining Operators

The operators `?.`, `?:`, `?[]` and `?()` to replace the common Lua idiom
`foo and foo.bar`. These allow more efficient re-use of intermediate results in deeply nested optional objects. `?.`, `?:` and `?[]` protect an indexing operation, while `?()` protects a function call, calling the function only if it exists.

## Block Initializer Clauses

Modified versions of several block constructs allow defining block locals in the opening condition of the block.

```lua
if name_list = exp_list then ... end

do
  local name_list = exp_list
  if select(1,name_list) then ... end
end
```

```lua
while name_list = exp_list do ... end

do
  local name_list = exp_list
  while select(1,name_list) do
    ...
    name_list = exp_list
  end
end
```

## Compact Expression-body Lambda

Lua's existing function syntax is already fairly compact, but for the specific case of a function which simply returns an exp_list it can be reduced further:

```lua
(foo,bar) => foo?[bar]
```
