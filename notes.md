for the phobos factorio mod add commands for running phobos.\
`/pho`, `/s-pho`, `/phobos`, `/silent-phobos`, `/measured-phobos` or so

with types there can be several optimizations related to comparisons
this below were some ideas but there is a lot more to be done and this idea is incomplete:
`foo == false` to `not foo` optimization if foo is known to never be `nil`
`foo == true` to `foo` with "convert to bool flag" optimization

-- TODO: osx is actually macOS nowadays. Incorporate that into the readme somehow

-- TODO: ask Therenas what name to put into the license file. Legal stuff is hard
