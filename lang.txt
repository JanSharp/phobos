  to add:
    `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `^=` composite assignment ops
      no multiple-assignment with these?
      parse to tree equivalent of LHS = LHS op ( RHS )
      `..=` can compose with a line of `..`
    `i++`
    `:[]()` operator for self-call by non-ident index
    `expr?.ident` `expr?[expr]` `expr?()` for safe-chaining
      `expr?:ident?(explist)` for SELF
    `^.` for `getmetatable()?.`
    `@` `@[]` for getraw()/setraw()
    `cond ?? explist :: explist` ternary op
      single `?` causes parsing difficulty with safe chaining ops
      sincle `:` causes parsing difficulty with self-call op
      foo?(bar):baz():baz()
    `local {foo, bar} = exp` table unpack as name in local statement
      unpack the named fields into locals, discard intermediate table
      `foo as foob` to rename?
    `(namelist)=>explist` for `function(namelist) return explist end`
    `if namelist = explist then` use first var as condition
        `if namelist = explist; cond then` explicit cond
        `while namelist = explist; cond do` while too?
    switch/case?
        implement as `(({})[case] or default)()` ?
        allow `return switch`?
    `const namelist ‘=’ explist`, compile-time constant folding? prevent re-assignment, allow reuse of common subexpressions
    `inline function` or `macro` at file or smaller scope
      not assignable
      no upvals?
    `static foo` vars for upvals only in scope for closure
      SETNIL statics, then CLOSURE, then JMP to close them
    string interpolation?
      evaluate it all then do one big concat
      $"" or $[[]] like a function call of $
      turn into concat series, expressions in {} break out as code
      tostring() sub expressions? or just let it error on non-string?
    branch annotations for coverage testing?
    compile time regex? builds to a function that uses patterns?

    type annotations, somehow? steal a bunch from TypeScript?
      compile time warning on assignment of incompatible types
      `expr!` to override deduction with assertion that T is not-nil
      `<T>expr` to override deduction with assertion that `expr` is `T`
      `Name:T` - this works fine in `local`, and in/after param lists.
      some way to declare type of a global? `global name:T`?
      or generally to declare a typed field into an existing table?
      `_ENV = <T>_ENV` with an interface?
      `T?`, `T|T`, `T&T`, `any`
      `interface T [extends U] { }`
